		<h1> Culture </h1>
		<h2> What is culture in the first place? </h2>
			<p> Culture is the identity of a specific group of people that determines them from the others. </p>
		<h2> Cordilleran Culture </h2>
			<p> We chose the cordilleran culture as our topic because it is one of the known cultures that we have here in the Philippines. There are different tribes in cordillera, but they somehow have resemblance on each other. Dialect, here in the cordillera region, many dialects are being used; Ilocano, Kankanaey, Ibaloi, Kalinga, Tagalog, etc. Cordilleran people are also known as “Igorots” or “People of the Mountains” and this is because they live in the mountain ranges of Cordillera. 
			</p>
		<h2> Why is it important? </h2>	
			<p>
				Culture is the treasure of society that makes us united and it reflects on who we are. We can see these treasures everywhere by people around us, places that we explore and the things we see that are unique. To understand cultural heritage we must first understand the culture and give respect to it. After that, we have to experience a culture and that makes us learn from it. Exploring other culture is fun because it gives us more knowledge on how to deal with other people.
