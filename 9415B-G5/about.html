	 		<p> About </p>
	 		<p>Culture is the treasure of society that makes us united and it reflects on who we are. We can see these treasures everywhere by people around us, places that we explore and the things we see that are unique. To understand cultural heritage we must first understand the culture and give respect to it. After that, we have to experience a culture and that makes us learn from it. Exploring other culture is fun because it gives us more knowledge on how to deal with other people.</p>
